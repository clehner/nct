# nct

**Namecoin tool** - a command line tool for managing Namecoin names

## Installation

    npm install -g namecointool

## Usage

    nct <command> [arguments]

Commands that require unlocking the wallet will prompt you to enter your
passphrase using a pinentry program.

Configuration for communicating with namecoind is read from
`~/.namecoin/namecoin.conf`.

### Commands

#### `list`

Show a list of names controlled by your wallet

#### `info <name>`

Show info about a name

#### `cat <name>`

Print the contents of a name. If the value is JSON, it is pretty-printed.

#### `edit <name>`

Edit a name. Opens your $EDITOR and saves the result when the editor exits. If
the value is JSON, it is pretty-printed for the editor and then printed
compactly for issuing the update. If the JSON data saved is invalid, you are
prompted to edit it again.

#### `update-expiring [<depth>]`

Update all names that are nearing expiration, i.e. are within `<depth>` blocks
of expiring. If unspecified, depth defaults to 4500, which is about a month.

## Todo

- Support registering new names
- Support transferring names
- Add bash/zsh completions
- Allow editing multiple names at once
